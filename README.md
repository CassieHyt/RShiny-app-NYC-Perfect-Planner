**Do you have allodoxaphobia?** 

**Do you have trouble with deciding how to spend your spare time?** 

**Do you have trouble with finding places for your favorite activity?** 


**If “Yes”, here is Your Savior!!** 
+ **Try our App [Perfect Planner] via Link: https://adsproj2group14.shinyapps.io/perfectplanner/**


+ **Summary**: 
 Image that on the morning of a sunny weekend, you want to go out for fun but have no idea about what to do or you have plenty of preferences in heart but can’t find a place to fulfill all your needs. Under such unpleasant situations, our app can save you out~ 

  In our app, after entering your current location, you can choose your top 3 “Most want-to-go places” to search for recommended areas that contain all your choices. Among all the recommendations, you can zoom in to have more detailed information about that area and then decide where to start your perfect day! 

 Opps! If you currently have no idea of what to do, don’t worry! Our app can even randomly choose them for you~



+ **Data Source**: 
 We mainly use U.S. government open data released on the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) website for building this shiny app. And the Deli and Market data can be found on the [NYC open data]( https://nycopendata.socrata.com/). 


+ **Contribution statement**:
